changes made to fit bc it really wont work:

line 368
from width: 100% to width 52%
from lorem30 to lorem25
time stamp: 2:20:09
what i tried: 
-made sure that the code are literally the same
-re-watch that part thousands of times
-checked and made sure if path of imports, bootstrap version is the same as the video
-did the whole video, restart from scratch 2x

*jquery.bxslider.css
line 33
from bottom: 200px to 85px (supposedly had to change it to 170px just like the vid but accdng to the video, i can change it until I get the perfect look
